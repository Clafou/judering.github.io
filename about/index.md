Welcome to my website. I am a composer/musician/performer and all round music lover based in Dublin, Ireland. I have been writing music for the past 15 years and have been greatly inspired by living in such places as Berlin, London, York, Paris and Dublin. In general my music stems from the electro-acoustic world and its core technique is based on the pratices of musique concrète. Over the years this has expanded and been influenced by more improvised and instrumental territories derived from a deep exploration of instrumental timbre through collaborative projects with a large number of solo musicians. My debut album [What Was](https://ergodos.ie/shop/records/what-was/) is out now on [Ergodos records](https://ergodos.ie).
